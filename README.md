  This program will host a game show buzzer server for other devices to connect to via websockets.
  Users can buzz in from their devices and the host will be able to see who buzzed in and in what order.
  I made this app in a day because I like to host trivia nights with friends and needed a reliable way for people to buzz in to answer.
  I'll be adding features to this going forward.
  Please feel free to fork and raise issues as you see fit.
